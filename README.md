# Platform Services

`platform-services` is a centralized repository containing configuration files for all platform-level services that are deployed using [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/)
. This includes Helm values, Kubernetes manifests, and any other configuration definitions required for the applications running on the platform.
